üòéHello, my name is Rafael, I've always been very curious about technology and it's become my passion. I'm extremely passionate about exact sciences, I'm fascinated by how it can always change for the better, just as I can too. 

‚öôÔ∏èI'm interested in entering the field of development so that I can change my life and people's lives by creating applications and solutions that can impact the world in some way. I believe that contribution, empathy, respect and education can change the world.

üìöA future developer, I'm a student at UFABC, with several courses from Udemy, Alura and DIO (Java, Python, Spring, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

```java
public class Rafael {
 String name = "Rafael Victorio Bezerra";
 String mainStack = "Java";
 
 System.out.print("My main tools: Spring, SQL, JavaScript, Python and GIT.");
}
```
